# My Environment

After some time losing and rebuilding my environment from scratch, I decided to
create this repository to hold all of my personal customizations for bash as
well as for emacs, my preferred text editor.

These are my personal customizations. If you want to use it, remember to add
your own customizations.

Hope this can be useful somehow.
